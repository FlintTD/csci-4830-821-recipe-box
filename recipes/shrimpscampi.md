# Shrimp Scampi Quesadillas

## Ingredients
*   2 pounds medium or large shrimp, shelled
*   3-6 cups of shredded queso fresco or monterey jack
*   3 tablespoons butter
*   1 tablespoon olive oil
*   4 large cloves of garlic, finely minced
*   1/2 cup cheap pinot grigio
*   1/4 cup broth (optional)
*   1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste
*   3 teaspoons red pepper flakes or to taste
*   Plenty of freshly ground black pepper, to taste
*   1/4 cup chopped parsley
*   Juice of half a lemon
*   Cilantro to taste (optional)
*   Plenty of corn tortillas, depending on how

## Preparation
1.  In a large sauce pan, melt 2 tablespoons butter with olive oil over
medium-low heat. Add garlic and saute until fragrant or about 1 minute. Add wine
and/or broth, salt, and red pepper flakes plus plenty of black pepper. Bring to
simmer and let wine/broth reduce by half, or about 3 minutes.

2.  Once wine is reduced, add shrimp and saute until just after they turn pink,
which should be about 2-4 minutes depending on size.

3.  While shrimp saute, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over
medium heat. After butter melts, add tortillas and cheese enough for each. Use a
brush or ladle to apply 1-2 tablespoons of the wine reduction over top of the
shrimp and cheese.

4.  After shrimp turn pink and cheese starts to melt, transfer shrimp to
tortillas. Add cilantro and extra cheese over shrimp.

5.  Fold over tortillas and flip until golden on both sides. Continue preparing
tortillas until shrimp is exhausted or guests are full. Enjoy with guacamole and
salsa!

Serves 3-4 sober people; 2 otherwise.
